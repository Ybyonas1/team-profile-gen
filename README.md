## Description
In this assignment the student was tasked with building a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. A unit test will be required for every part of my code.

This assignment was also a great way for me to gain some hands on skills in using OOP. This did seem to be one of the longer assignments, but nonetheless I am glad to finally get it done.

## Notes

1. The Team Profile Generator will allow you to build 3 prolfiles for a manager, engineer, and intern
2. The Team Profile Generator will generate the profiles on an HTML page
3. The each job selection has a unique color code.
4. The Team Profile Generator will prompt the neccessary questions via the terminal server using Node.js

## Visuals
Here is a screenshot of a generated team profile.
